*Please ignore the loading.py file, this was for testing only*

This ReadMe file will be my report on the figures generated inside this Repository. 

Having initially chosen the breast cancer dataset, I've decided to change to the Wine dataset so as to use the common dataset betwene myself and my in-class partner Olga. 

Not having done much research on this dataset prior to class, I decided to generate a couple of figures that would help give me a general understanding of the dataset. The first figure I generated was a heatmap. The heatmap works by having each column plotted as a correlation between each other. This helped identify which two attributes of the wine were highly correlated (Flavanoids and Total Phenols had the highest correlation compared to the others). Second, I made a histogram figure to get a better understanding of the distribution between each column/attribute. 

Having this information I decided to engage in a way that showed the differences between the attributes and the class of the wines. This gave me a better understanding of the differences/ranges between the 3 different wine categories. What this enabled me to conclude were things like, the Alcolhol % and the Magnesium levels seem to be correlated when comparing the boxplots, but not so on the heatmap. 

Travis CI has been implemented and exits with code 0 so whould be good to go!
